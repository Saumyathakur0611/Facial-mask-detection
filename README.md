# Facial-mask-detection
This project makes use of OpenCV and a custom model by CNN to predict whether a person is wearing a mask or not.
It could be used in restaurants and other public places, where initially people were employed to check the same thing during the pandemic phase.
The same could be deployed to a traffic system wherein, the system would detect if the people riding their bikes are wearing helmets or not.
